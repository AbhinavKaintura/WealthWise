Page 1 of 31The return assumptions in Goal Planning & Monitoring are not reflective of any specific
product, and do not include any fees or expenses that may be incurred by investing in
specific products. The actual returns of a specific product may be more or less than the
returns used in Goal Planning & Monitoring.  It is not possible to directly invest in an index.
Financial forecasts, rates of return, risk, inflation, and other assumptions may be used as the
basis for illustrations. They should not be considered a guarantee of future performance or a
guarantee of achieving overall financial objectives.  Past performance is not a guarantee or a
predictor of future results of either the indices or any particular investment.IMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by Goal Planning & Monitoring
regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not
reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results.
Goal Planning & Monitoring results may vary with each use and over time.Information that you provided about your assets, financial goals, and personal situation are
key assumptions for the calculations and projections in this Report.  Please review the
Report sections titled "Personal Information and Summary of Financial Goals", "Current
Portfolio Allocation", and "Tax and Inflation Options" to verify the accuracy of these
assumptions.  If any of the assumptions are incorrect, you should notify your financial
advisor.  Even small changes in assumptions can have a substantial impact on the results
shown in this Report.  The information provided by you should be reviewed periodically and
updated when either the information or your circumstances change.Information Provided by YouGoal Planning & Monitoring Assumptions and Limitations
All asset and net worth information included in this Report was provided by you or your
designated agents, and is not a substitute for the information contained in the official
account statements provided to you by custodians. The current asset data and values
contained in those account statements should be used to update the asset information
included in this Report, as necessary.
Assumptions and Limitations
Goal Planning & Monitoring offers several methods of calculating results, each of which
provides one outcome from a wide range of possible outcomes.  All results in this Report
are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees
of future results.  All results use simplifying assumptions that do not completely or
accurately reflect your specific circumstances.  No Plan or Report has the ability to accurately
predict the future.  As investment returns, inflation, taxes, and other economic conditions
vary from the Goal Planning & Monitoring assumptions, your actual results will vary
(perhaps significantly) from those presented in this Report.
All Goal Planning & Monitoring calculations use asset class returns, not returns of actual
investments.  The projected return assumptions used in this Report are estimates based on
average annual returns for each asset class. The portfolio returns are calculated by
weighting individual return assumptions for each asset class according to your portfolio
allocation.  The portfolio returns may have been modified by including adjustments to the
total return and the inflation rate.  The portfolio returns assume reinvestment of interest
and dividends at net asset value without taxes, and also assume that the portfolio has been
rebalanced to reflect the initial recommendation.  No portfolio rebalancing costs, including
taxes, if applicable, are deducted from the portfolio value.  No portfolio allocation eliminates
risk or guarantees investment results.
Goal Planning & Monitoring does not provide recommendations for any products or
securities.IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE INFORMATION

Page 3 of 31Risks Inherent in Investing
Investing in fixed income securities involves interest rate risk, credit risk, and inflation risk.
Interest rate risk is the possibility that bond prices will decrease because of an interest rate
increase. When interest rates rise, bond prices and the values of fixed income securities fall.
When interest rates fall, bond prices and the values of fixed income securities rise. Credit
risk is the risk that a company will not be able to pay its debts, including the interest on its
bonds.  This risk is higher with non-investment grade fixed income securities.  Inflation risk is
the possibility that the interest paid on an investment in bonds will be lower than the
inflation rate, decreasing purchasing power.
Cash alternatives typically include money market securities and U.S. treasury bills. Investing
in such cash alternatives involves inflation risk.  In addition, investments in money market
securities may involve credit risk and a risk of principal loss.  Because money market
securities are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency, there is no guarantee the value of your investment will be
maintained at $1.00 per share.  U.S. Treasury bills are subject to market risk if sold prior to
maturity.  Market risk is the possibility that the value, when sold, might be less than the
purchase price.
Investing in stock securities involves volatility risk, market risk, business risk, and industry
risk. The prices of most stocks fluctuate. Volatility risk is the chance that the value of a stock
will fall. Market risk is chance that the prices of all stocks will fall due to conditions in the
economic environment. Business risk is the chance that a specific company’s stock will fall
because of issues affecting it. Industry risk is the chance that a set of factors particular to an
industry group will adversely affect stock prices within the industry.  (See “Asset Class –
Stocks” in the Glossary section of this Important Disclosure Information for a summary of
the relative potential volatility of different types of stocks.)
International investing involves additional risks including, but not limited to, changes in
currency exchange rates, differences in accounting and taxation policies, and political or
economic instabilities that can increase or decrease returns.
Commodities are generally considered speculative because of the significant potential for
investment loss.  Commodities are volatile investments and should only form a small part of
a diversified portfolio.  There may be sharp price fluctuations even during periods when
prices overall are rising.Report Is a Snapshot and Does Not Provide Legal, Tax, or Accounting Advice
This Report provides a snapshot of your current financial position and can help you to focus
on your financial resources and goals, and to create a plan of action.  Because the results
are calculated over many years, small changes can create large differences in future results.
You should use this Report to help you focus on the factors that are most important to you.
This Report does not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.  Before making decisions with
legal, tax, or accounting ramifications, you should consult appropriate professionals for
advice that is specific to your situation.
This information is provided for your convenience, but should not be used as a substitute for
your account's monthly statements and trade confirmations.  It has been gathered from
information provided by you and other sources believed to be reliable.
Goal Planning & Monitoring Methodology
Goal Planning & Monitoring offers several methods of calculating results, each of which
provides one outcome from a wide range of possible outcomes.  The methods used are:
“Average Returns,” “Bad Timing,” “Class Sensitivity,” and “Monte Carlo Simulations.”
Results Using Average Returns
The Results Using Average Returns are calculated using one average return for your
pre-retirement period and one average return for your post-retirement period.  Average
Returns are a simplifying assumption.  In the real world, investment returns can (and often
do) vary widely from year to year and vary widely from a long-term average return.
Results with Bad Timing
Results with Bad Timing are calculated by using low returns in one or two years, and
average returns for all remaining years of the Plan.  For most Plans, the worst time for low
returns is when you begin taking substantial withdrawals from your portfolio.  The Results
with Bad Timing assume that you earn a low return in the year(s) you select and then an
Adjusted Average Return in all other years. This Adjusted Average Return is calculated so
that the average return of the Results with Bad Timing is equal to the return(s) used in
calculating the Results Using Average Returns.  This allows you to compare two results with
the same overall average return, where one (the Results with Bad Timing) has low returns in
one or two years.
The default for the first year of low returns is two standard deviations less than the average
return, and the default for the second year is one standard deviation less than the average
return.IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE INFORMATION
10/31/2016Prepared for : Sam and Sue Johnson Company: Raymond James Prepared by: Jim Zientara, MBA, CIMA
Page 4 of 31Results Using Class Sensitivity
The Results Using Class Sensitivity are calculated by using different return assumptions for
one or more asset classes during the years you select.  These results show how your Plan
would be affected if the annual returns for one or more asset classes were different than
the average returns for a specified period in your Plan.
Results Using Monte Carlo Simulations
Monte Carlo simulations are used to show how variations in rates of return each year can
affect your results.  A Monte Carlo simulation calculates the results of your Plan by running
it many times, each time using a different sequence of returns.  Some sequences of returns
will give you better results, and some will give you worse results.  These multiple trials
provide a range of possible results, some successful (you would have met all your goals) and
some unsuccessful (you would not have met all your goals).  The percentage of trials that
were successful is the probability that your Plan, with all its underlying assumptions, could
be successful.  In Goal Planning & Monitoring, this is the Probability of Success.
Analogously, the percentage of trials that were unsuccessful is the Probability of Failure.
The Results Using Monte Carlo Simulations indicate the likelihood that an event may occur
as well as the likelihood that it may not occur. In analyzing this information, please note
that the analysis does not take into account actual market conditions, which may severely
affect the outcome of your goals over the long-term.
Goal Planning & Monitoring Presentation of Results
The Results Using Average Returns, Bad Timing, and Class Sensitivity display the results
using an “Estimated % of Goal Funded” and a “Safety Margin.”
Estimated % of Goal Funded
For each Goal, the “Estimated % of Goal Funded” is the sum of the assets used to fund the
Goal divided by the sum of the Goal’s expenses. All values are in current dollars.  A result of
100% or more does not guarantee that you will reach a Goal, nor does a result under
100% guarantee that you will not. Rather, this information is meant to identify possible
shortfalls in this Plan, and is not a guarantee that a certain percentage of your Goals will be
funded. The percentage reflects a projection of the total cost of the Goal that was actually
funded based upon all the assumptions that are included in this Plan, and assumes that you
execute all aspects of the Plan as you have indicated.
Safety Margin
The Safety Margin is the estimated value of your assets at the end of this Plan, based on all
the assumptions included in this Report. Only you can determine if that Safety Margin is
sufficient for your needs.Bear Market Loss and Bear Market Test
The Bear Market Loss shows how a portfolio would have been impacted during the worst
bear market since the Great Depression.  Depending on the composition of the portfolio,
the worst bear market is either the "Great Recession" or the "Bond Bear Market."
The Great Recession, from November 2007 through February 2009, was the worst bear
market for stocks since the Great Depression. In Goal Planning & Monitoring, the Great
Recession Return is the rate of return, during the Great Recession, for a portfolio comprised
of cash, bonds, stocks, and alternatives, with an asset mix equivalent to the portfolio
referenced.
The Bond Bear Market, from July 1979 through February 1980, was the worst bear market
for bonds since the Great Depression. In Goal Planning & Monitoring, the Bond Bear Market
Return is the rate of return, for the Bond Bear Market period, for a portfolio comprised of
cash, bonds, stocks, and alternatives, with an asset mix equivalent to the portfolio
referenced.
The Bear Market Loss shows: 1) either the Great Recession Return or the Bond Bear Market
Return, whichever is lower, and 2) the potential loss, if you had been invested in this
cash-bond-stock-alternative portfolio during the period with the lower return. In general,
most portfolios with a stock allocation of 20% or more have a lower Great Recession
Return, and most portfolios with a combined cash and bond allocation of 80% or more
have a lower Bond Bear Market Return.
The Bear Market Test, included in the Stress Tests, examines the impact on your Plan results
if an identical Great Recession or Bond Bear Market, whichever would be worse, occurred
this year.  The Bear Market Test shows the likelihood that you could fund your Needs,
Wants and Wishes after experiencing such an event.IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE INFORMATION
10/31/2016Prepared for : Sam and Sue Johnson Company: Raymond James Prepared by: Jim Zientara, MBA, CIMA
Page 5 of 31Even though you are using projected returns for all other Goal Planning & Monitoring
results, the Bear Market Loss and Bear Market Test use returns calculated from historical
indices. These results are calculated using only three asset classes – Cash, Bonds, and
Stocks. Alternative asset classes (e.g., real estate, commodities) are included in the Stocks
asset class.  The indices and the resulting returns for the Great Recession and the Bond Bear
Market are:
Because the Bear Market Loss and Bear Market Test use the returns from asset class indices
rather than the returns of actual investments, they do not represent the performance for
any specific portfolio, and are not a guarantee of minimum or maximum levels of losses or
gains for any portfolio.  The actual performance of your portfolio may differ substantially
from those shown in the Great Recession Return, the Bond Bear Market Return, the Bear
Market Loss, and the Bear Market Test.Asset Class Index Great Recession

Goal Planning & Monitoring Risk Assessment
The Goal Planning & Monitoring Risk Assessment highlights some – but not all – of the
trade-offs you might consider when deciding how to invest your money.  This approach
does not provide a comprehensive, psychometrically-based, or scientifically-validated profile
of your risk tolerance, loss tolerance, or risk capacity, and is provided for informational
purposes only.Based on your specific circumstances, you must decide the appropriate balance between
potential risks and potential returns.  Goal Planning & Monitoring does not and cannot
adequately understand or assess the appropriate risk/return balance for you. Goal Planning
& Monitoring requires you to select a risk score. Once selected, three important pieces of
information are available to help you determine the appropriateness of your score: a
cash-bond-stock portfolio, the impact of a Bear Market Loss (either the Great Recession or
the Bond Bear Market, whichever is lower) on this portfolio, and a graph showing how your
score compares to the risk score of others in your age group.Goal Planning & Monitoring uses your risk score to select a risk-based portfolio on the
Target Band page.  This risk-based portfolio selection is provided for informational purposes
only, and you should consider it to be a starting point for conversations with your advisor.  It
is your responsibility to select the Target Portfolio you want Goal Planning & Monitoring to
use.  The selection of your Target Portfolio, and other investment decisions, should be made
by you, after discussions with your advisor and, if needed, other financial and/or legal
professionals.Executive SummaryExecutive Summary

Cash Management
Managing spending and savings effectively is a key component of a successful plan. A review of debt, such as credit cards and
mortgages, as well as spending and savings accounts can help to ensure that you are getting the most from your money and not
paying too much in unnecessary interest or fees.
Social Security Status
Personal Information
Your Full Retirement Age (FRA) is the age that you would receive 100% of your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). Depending on the
year you were born, your FRA is between 65-67 years old. Taking benefits before or after your FRA will decrease or increase the
amount you receive, respectively.
Sam's FRA is 66 and 0 months in 2020.
Sue's FRA is 66 and 0 months in 2020.
Your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is the benefit you would receive if you began benefits at your Full Retirement Age (FRA). It is
calculated from the earnings on which you paid Social Security taxes, throughout your life.
Sam's estimated annual PIA is $26,100
Sue's estimated annual PIA is $13,050
Strategy Information
Sam files a normal application at 66 in 2020.
Sue files a normal application at 66 in 2020.
Using this strategy, your household's total lifetime benefits would be $1,057,050 in today's dollars.Executive Summary

Notes
Selected Strategy:
You apply for and begin benefits at the later of your current age or age 62. The benefit is
automatically adjusted to account for excess earnings from part-time work, if applicable, and
taking benefits prior to your FRA.  If you are age 62 or older, this option is not available.
This strategy is available only if you are married. The higher wage earner applies for and begins
benefits at age 70. The lower wage earner applies for and begins benefits at his/her FRA. The
higher/lower wage earners are determined based on the employment incomes you specified.This strategy is available only if you are married. The lower wage earner applies for and suspends
taking benefits until age 70. The lower wage earner can file at or after his/her FRA, at which time
the spouse (the higher wage earner) files for and takes spousal benefits. The spouse then files for
and begins his/her own benefit at age 70, at the higher benefit amount.
The higher wage earner makes a restricted application at his/her FRA. Restricted application
allows the account holder to apply only for the "spousal benefit" s/he would be due under dual
entitlement rules. At any age beyond his/her FRA, the higher wage earner can apply for and
receive benefits based on his/her own work history.This is the strategy you selected.
At FRA:
You apply for and begin retirement benefits at your Full Retirement Age (FRA), which is
determined by your date of birth.  If the retirement age you specified is after your FRA, we
assume you will begin benefits at FRA, and we will adjust the benefit for inflation until your
retirement age.
At Retirement:
You apply for and begin retirement benefits at the retirement age shown. The benefit is
automatically adjusted to account for excess earnings from part-time work and/or taking benefits
prior to your FRA, if either is applicable.
As soon as possible:
At age 70:
You apply for and begin benefits at age 70.
(Higher Wage Earner) begins at age 70 and (Lower Wage Earner) begins at FRA:The lower wage earner makes a restricted application at his/her FRA. Restricted application allows
the account holder to apply only for the "spousal benefit" s/he would be due under dual
entitlement rules. At any age beyond his/her FRA, the lower wage earner can apply for and
receive benefits based on his/her own work history.
(Lower Wage Earner) files/suspends and (Higher Wage Earner) restricted application:
Maximized Benefits:
This is the strategy that provides the highest estimate of lifetime Social Security income, assuming
you live to the age(s) shown on the Detailed Results page.
Total Lifetime Benefit:
The total estimate of benefits you and your co-client, if applicable, would receive in your lifetime,
assuming you live to the age(s) shown on the Detailed Results page.  This amount is in current
(non-inflated) dollars.
This strategy is available only if you are married. The higher wage earner applies for and suspends
taking benefits until age 70. The higher wage earner can file at or after his/her FRA, at which
time the spouse (the lower wage earner) files for and takes spousal benefits. The spouse then files
for and begins his/her own benefit at age 70, at the higher benefit amount.(Higher Wage Earner) files/suspends and (Lower Wage Earner) restricted application:Break Even Point:
The age(s) at which this strategy would provide benefits equivalent to the “As Soon As Possible”
strategy.  If you live longer than the “break even” age for a strategy, your total lifetime benefits
using that strategy would be greater than the lifetime benefits of the “As Soon As Possible”
strategy.  If you are older than age 62 and the “As Soon As Possible” strategy is not shown, the
break even comparison uses the strategy that begins at the earliest age(s) as the baseline for
comparison.Glossary

Page 28 of 31Asset Allocation is the process of determining what portions of your portfolio holdings are
to be invested in the various asset classes.Asset Allocation
Asset Class
Asset Class is a standard term that broadly defines a category of investments. The three
basic asset classes are Cash, Bonds, and Stocks. Bonds and Stocks are often further
subdivided into more narrowly defined classes.  Some of the most common asset classes are
defined below.
Cash and Cash Alternatives
Cash typically includes bank accounts or certificates of deposit, which are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to a limit per account. Cash Alternatives typically
include money market securities, U.S. treasury bills, and other investments that are readily
convertible to cash, have a stable market value, and a very short-term maturity. U.S.
Treasury bills are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and, when
held to maturity, provide safety of principal.  (See the “Risks Inherent in Investing” section
in this Important Disclosure Information for a summary of the risks associated with
investing in cash alternatives.)
Bonds
Bonds are either domestic (U.S.) or global debt securities issued by either private
corporations or governments.  (See the “Risks Inherent in Investing” section in this
Important Disclosure Information for a summary of the risks associated with investing in
bonds.  Bonds are also called “fixed income securities.”)
Domestic government bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
Government and have superior liquidity and, when held to maturity, safety of principal.
Domestic corporate bonds carry the credit risk of their issuers and thus usually offer
additional yield.  Domestic government and corporate bonds can be sub-divided based
upon their term to maturity. Short-term bonds have an approximate term to maturity of 1
to 5 years; intermediate-term bonds have an approximate term to maturity of 5 to 10
years; and, long-term bonds have an approximate term to maturity greater than 10 years.Commodities
A commodity is food, metal, or another fixed physical substance that investors buy or sell,
usually via futures contracts, and generally traded in very large quantities.Stocks
Stocks are equity securities of domestic and foreign corporations.  (See the “Risks Inherent
in Investing” section in this Important Disclosure Information for a summary of the risks
associated with investing in stocks.)
Domestic stocks are equity securities of U.S. corporations. Domestic stocks are often
sub-divided based upon the market capitalization of the company (the market value of the
company's stock). "Large cap" stocks are from larger companies, "mid cap" from the
middle range of companies, and "small cap" from smaller, perhaps newer, companies.
Generally, small cap stocks experience greater market volatility than stocks of companies
with larger capitalization.  Small cap stocks are generally those from companies whose
capitalization is less than $500 million, mid cap stocks those between $500 million and $5
billion, and large cap over $5 billion.
Large cap, mid cap and small cap may be further sub-divided into "growth" and "value"
categories. Growth companies are those with an orientation towards growth, often
characterized by commonly used metrics such as higher price-to-book and
price-to-earnings ratios. Analogously, value companies are those with an orientation
towards value, often characterized by commonly used metrics such as lower price-to-book
and price-to-earnings ratios.
International stocks are equity securities from foreign corporations. International stocks are
often sub-divided into those from "developed" countries and those from "emerging
markets." The emerging markets are in less developed countries with emerging economies
that may be characterized by lower income per capita, less developed infrastructure and
nascent capital markets. These "emerging markets" usually are less economically and
politically stable than the "developed markets."  Investing in international stocks involves
special risks, among which include foreign exchange volatility and risks of investing under
different tax, regulatory and accounting standards.
Asset Mix is the combination of asset classes within a portfolio, and is usually expressed as a
percentage for each asset class.Asset Mix
Bear Market Loss
The Bear Market Loss shows how a portfolio would have been impacted during the Great
Recession (November 2007 through February 2009) or the Bond Bear Market (July 1979
through February 1980). The Bear Market Loss shows: 1) either the Great Recession Return
or the Bond Bear Market Return, whichever is lower, and 2) the potential loss, if you had
been invested in this cash-bond-stock-alternative portfolio during the period with the lower
return.  See Great Recession Return and Bond Bear Market Return.Glossary
10/31/2016Prepared for : Sam and Sue Johnson Company: Raymond James Prepared by: Jim Zientara, MBA, CIMA
Page 29 of 31Bear Market Test
The Bear Market Test, included in the Stress Tests, examines the impact on your Plan results
if a Bear Market Loss occurred this year. The Bear Market Test shows the likelihood that you
could fund your Needs, Wants and Wishes after experiencing such an event. See Bear
Market Loss.
Bond Bear Market Return
The Bond Bear Market Return is the rate of return for a cash-bond-stock-alternative
portfolio during the Bond Bear Market (July 1979 through February 1980), the worst bear
market for bonds since the Great Depression. Goal Planning & Monitoring shows a Bond
Bear Market Return for your Current, Risk-based, and Target Portfolios, calculated using
historical returns of four broad-based asset class indices. See Great Recession Return.
Bypass Trust
An estate planning device used to pass down assets after death without subjecting them to
the estate tax.
Cash Receipt Schedule
A Cash Receipt Schedule consists of one or more years of future after-tax amounts received
from the anticipated sale of an Other Asset, exercising of Stock Options grants, or proceeds
from Restricted Stock grants.
Confidence Zone
See Monte Carlo Confidence Zone.Concentrated Position
A Concentrated Position is when your portfolio contains a significant amount (as a
percentage of the total portfolio value) in individual stock or bonds.  Concentrated Positions
have the potential to increase the risk of your portfolio.
Current Dollars
The Results of Goal Planning & Monitoring calculations are in Future Dollars.  To help you
compare dollar amounts in different years, we also express the Results in Current Dollars,
calculated by discounting the Future Dollars by the sequence of inflation rates used in the
Plan.
Current Portfolio
Your Current Portfolio is comprised of all the investment assets you currently own (or a
subset of your assets, based on the information you provided for this Plan), categorized by
Asset Class and Asset Mix.Fund All Goals
Fund All Goals is one of two ways for your assets and retirement income to be used to fund
your goals.  The other is Earmark, which means that an asset or retirement income is
assigned to one or more goals, and will be used only for those goals.  Fund All Goals means
that the asset or income is not earmarked to fund specific goals, and can be used to fund
any goal, as needed in the calculations.
Future Dollars
Future Dollars are inflated dollars.  The Results of Goal Planning & Monitoring calculations
are in Future Dollars.  To help you compare dollar amounts in different years, we discount
the Future Dollar amounts by the inflation rates used in the calculations and display the
Results in the equivalent Current Dollars.
Great Recession Return
The Great Recession Return is the rate of return for a cash-bond-stock-alternative portfolio
during the Great Recession (November 2007 through February 2009), the worst bear
market for stocks since the Great Depression. Goal Planning & Monitoring shows a Great
Recession Return for your Current, Risk-based, and Target Portfolios, calculated using
historical returns of four broad-based asset class indices. See Bond Bear Market Return.
Inflation Rate
Inflation is the percentage increase in the cost of goods and services for a specified time
period.  A historical measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In Goal Planning
& Monitoring, the Inflation Rate is selected by your advisor, and can be adjusted in different
scenarios.
Liquidity
Liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be converted into cash.
Monte Carlo Confidence Zone
The Monte Carlo Confidence Zone is the range of probabilities that you (and/or your
advisor) have selected as your target range for the Monte Carlo Probability of Success in
your Plan.  The Confidence Zone reflects the Monte Carlo Probabilities of Success with
which you would be comfortable, based upon your Plan, your specific time horizon, risk
profile, and other factors unique to you.Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust
An irrevocable trust set up with a life insurance policy as the asset, allowing the grantor of
the policy to exempt the asset away from his or her taxable estate.Glossary
10/31/2016Prepared for : Sam and Sue Johnson Company: Raymond James Prepared by: Jim Zientara, MBA, CIMA
Page 30 of 31Monte Carlo Probability of Success / Probability of Failure
The Monte Carlo Probability of Success is the percentage of trials of your Plan that were
successful.  If a Monte Carlo simulation runs your Plan 1,000 times, and if 600 of those runs
are successful (i.e., all your goals are funded and you have at least $1 of Safety Margin),
then the Probability of Success for that Plan, with all its underlying assumptions, would be
60%, and the Probability of Failure would be 40%.
Monte Carlo Simulations
Monte Carlo simulations are used to show how variations in rates of return each year can
affect your results.  A Monte Carlo simulation calculates the results of your Plan by running
it many times, each time using a different sequence of returns.  Some sequences of returns
will give you better results, and some will give you worse results.  These multiple trials
provide a range of possible results, some successful (you would have met all your goals) and
some unsuccessful (you would not have met all your goals).
Needs / Wants / Wishes
In Goal Planning & Monitoring, you choose an importance level from 10 to 1 (where 10 is
the highest) for each of your financial goals.  Then, the importance levels are divided into
three groups: Needs, Wants, and Wishes.  Needs are the goals that you consider necessary
for your lifestyle, and are the goals that you must fulfill.  Wants are the goals that you
would really like to fulfill, but could live without.  Wishes are the “dream goals” that you
would like to fund, although you won’t be too dissatisfied if you can’t fund them.  In Goal
Planning & Monitoring, Needs are your most important goals, then Wants, then Wishes.
Portfolio Set
A Portfolio Set is a group of portfolios that provides a range of risk and return strategies for
different investors.
Portfolio Total Return
A Portfolio Total Return is determined by weighting the return assumption for each Asset
Class according to the Asset Mix.
Probability of Success / Probability of Failure
See Monte Carlo Probability of Success / Probability of Failure.
Real Return
The Real Return is the Total Return of your portfolio minus the Inflation Rate.Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the volatility of an investment, an asset class,
or a portfolio.  It measures the degree by which an actual return might vary from the
average return, or mean.  Typically, the higher the standard deviation, the higher the
potential risk of the investment, asset class, or portfolio.Safety Margin
The Safety Margin is the hypothetical portfolio value at the end of the Plan. A Safety Margin
of zero indicates the portfolio was depleted before the Plan ended.Recommended Scenario
The Recommended Scenario is the scenario selected by your advisor to be shown on the
Results page, in Play Zone, and in the Presentation.
Retirement Start Date
For married couples, retirement in Goal Planning & Monitoring begins when both the client
and spouse are retired. For single, divorced, or widowed clients, retirement begins when the
client retires.
Risk
Risk is the chance that the actual return of an investment, asset class, or portfolio will be
different from its expected or average return.
Risk-based Portfolio
The risk-based portfolio is the Model Portfolio associated with the risk score you selected.
Star Track provides a summary of your Plan results over time, using a bar graph.  Each bar
shows the Monte Carlo Probability of Success for your Recommended Scenario, on the date
specified, compared to the Monte Carlo Probability of Success for a scenario using all Target
values.Star Track
Target Goal Amount
The Target Goal Amount is the amount you would expect to spend, or the amount you
would like to spend, for each financial goal.Target Band
The Target Band is the portfolio(s) that could be appropriate for you, based upon the
risk-based portfolio.Glossary
10/31/2016Prepared for : Sam and Sue Johnson Company: Raymond James Prepared by: Jim Zientara, MBA, CIMA
Page 31 of 31Target Retirement Age
Target Retirement Age is the age at which you would like to retire.
Target Savings Amount
In the Resources section of Goal Planning & Monitoring, you enter the current annual
additions being made to your investment assets.  The total of these additions is your Target
Savings Amount.
Time Horizon
Time Horizon is the period from now until the time the assets in this portfolio will begin to
be used.
Total Return
Total Return is an assumed, hypothetical growth rate for a specified time period.  The Total
Return is either (1) the Portfolio Total Return or (2) as entered by you or your advisor.  Also
see “Real Return.”
Wants
See "Needs / Wants / Wishes".
Willingness
In Goal Planning & Monitoring, in addition to specifying Target Goal Amounts, a Target
Savings Amount, and Target Retirement Ages, you also specify a Willingness to adjust these
Target values.  The Willingness choices are Very Willing, Somewhat Willing, Slightly Willing,
and Not at All.
Wishes
